### Hi there 👋
My name is Mariusz Sabath, and I am a Senior Technical Staff Member (STSM) in Hybrid Cloud at IBM T.J. Watson Research Center.

My research interests are system management and distributed, scalable environments in Hybrid Cloud.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on workload identity in hybrid and multi-cloud scenarios for Cloud Native environments
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about attestation and chain-of-trust
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Zero-trust in context of identity in Cloud Native
